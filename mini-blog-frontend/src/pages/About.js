        <b>'Navratri'</b> means <b>'nine nights</b>.' 'Nava' means 'nine,’ and 'Ratri' means
        'night.' Night provides rest and rejuvenation. During the night, you
        turn inwards through sleep, and you wake up feeling refreshed and rested
        in the morning. In the same way, Navratri or the ‘nine nights’ is that
        time of the year when you get the chance to experience deep rest. This
        deep rest brings freedom from all kinds of botherations, deep
        relaxation, and creativity. Fasting, meditation, prayers, and other
        spiritual practices performed during this period help bring about this
        deep rest. Even refraining from over-indulging in sense objects during
        this time aid the process of attaining deep rest. Our spirit: The source
        of deep rest Our spirit has existed since time immemorial. It is the
        boundless and the eternal source of energy of this universe. During
        Navratri, even the subtle energies in the environment enhance and assist
        one’s experience of reaching the spirit. The prayer, chanting, and
        meditation performed during Navratri connect us with our spirit. Getting
        in touch with the spirit invokes positive qualities within us and
        destroys laziness, pride, obsession, cravings, and aversions. When
        stress in the form of negative emotions is destroyed, we experience the
        deep rest of the transforming nine nights. Devi Puja: Honoring the
        Omnipresent Energy Devi represents the omnipresent cosmic Energy. The
        whole Creation is permeated by this Energy. The prosperity that we enjoy
        in our daily lives is a manifestation of Devi. Mother Divine serves us
        in so many forms. The forms of our mother, father, friends, husband,
        wife, son, daughter and also the Guru. The revolving planets and the
        moon is Devi performing aarti to us. Through puja we say, “Oh Mother,
        whatever you give to me I give back to you. For example, during the
        Puja, we offer food grains to Devi as Nature provides us with food. Devi
        Puja is an expression of expanded consciousness showing reverence to the
        whole Creation. The puja that we perform during the 9 days of Navratri
        is a way of honouring the Devi and showing our gratitude to the Mother
        Divine. While attending the puja we give up all our worldly activities
        for a while and enter into deep meditation. Gurudev Sri Sri Ravi Shankar
        says, “There is Devi energy (Shakti) within all of us. Devi is not
        somewhere else, not in some other world. If we sit deep in meditation,
        the glow within the body will brighten, and will expand and spread
        outside. This is Devi Puja.”
